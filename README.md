# Showcase by Kene  

This repository showcases some Bioengineering (BIO) and Computer Science (CS) projects I have completed.
The projects often contain intellectual property and so, I am unable to share the entirety of the work that was done.
More projects are ongoing. Looking forward to sharing them in the future.
